## Course Description
**Official Calendar:** Advanced or specialized topics in database design, modelling, and implementation. This course may be taken more than once for credit. Credit will be granted for only one of COSC 416 or COSC 516 when the subject matter is of the same nature.<br>
**Prerequisite:** None. Prior database experience is helpful but not required.

**Specific description:** This course provides an applied introduction to database systems deployed in the cloud. The course begins with a review of database foundations including the relational model, SQL, and NoSQL systems. Each week a particular database system will be examined including hands-on experience with deploying and using the system. Specific systems explored include MySQL on Amazon Web Services, SQL Server/Azure DB on Microsoft Azure, and Bigtable on Google Cloud. Each student will select a database to study and present, and develop a lab assignment for other students to complete.

## Course Objectives
**Course Format:** Each course session will be done in person and streamed on Zoom. Each week a different database is presented. The first class of the week provides foundations on the database system and its particular features and use cases. Students will complete an interactive lab assignment on the database by the end of the second class of the week.

**Learning Outcomes:**
 - Understand different database systems and their particular use cases.
 - Proficiency in creating a database system on each of the three major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google).
 - Experience creating technical summary documents and learning activities to educate others.
 - Mastery of constructing programs to interact with cloud databases including using testing frameworks.
 - Exposure to a variety of database technologies and systems and the ability to determine when to use them.
 - Practice allocating and managing resources on a cloud provider and monitoring billing and costs.

## Grievances and Complaints Procedures
A student who has a complaint related to this course should follow the procedures summarized below:<br>
- The student should attempt to resolve the matter with the instructor first. Students may talk first to someone other than the instructor if they do not feel, for whatever reason, that they can directly approach the instructor. 
- If the complaint is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, the student should e-mail the Associate Head, Dr. Yves Lucet at yves.lucet@ubc.ca or the Department Head, John Braun at john.braun@ubc.ca.
 
## Your Responsibilities
Your responsibilities to this class and to your education as a whole include attendance and participation. You have a
responsibility to help create a classroom environment where all may learn. At the most basic level, this means you will
respect the other members of the class and the instructor and treat them with the courtesy you hope to receive in return.
Inappropriate classroom behavior may include: disruption of the classroom atmosphere, engaging in non-class activities,
talking on a cell-phone, inappropriate use of profanity in classroom discussion, use of abusive or disrespectful language
toward the instructor, a student in the class, or about other individuals or groups.

## Academic Integrity
The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.  As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.  At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.  This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.  Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.  For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.  Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences. 
A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic Calendar at:  http://okanagan.students.ubc.ca/calendar/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.
  If you have any questions about how academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.
